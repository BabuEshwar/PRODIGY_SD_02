# Number Guessing Game - Prodigy Infotech Internship Task

## Overview
This is a console-based Number Guessing Game developed in Java as part of an internship project at Prodigy Infotech. The program generates a random number between defined bounds and challenges the user to guess it with feedback on each attempt.

## Features
- Random number generation between configurable lower and upper bounds.
- User inputs their guess with real-time feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
- Input validation to ensure only integers are accepted.
- Keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it upon a correct guess.
- Friendly user interface with clear prompts and messages.

## How to Run
1. Make sure Java JDK is installed.
2. Compile the program:
3. Run the compiled class:
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to guess the number.

## Sample Output
I have picked a number between 1 and 100.
Can you guess it? Enter your number:
Your guess: 50
Too low! Try again.
Your guess: 75
Too high! Try again.
Your guess: 63
ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You guessed the number 63 in 3 attempts.
